  Query all values for the given property.  
  Optionally, a query can be included to filter the results.  
  For example, if we want to get the names of all resources in the namespace foo, we can pass a query with the filter `{property: namespace, values:['foo']}`
  
  **Default limit is** 1,000  
  A value of -1 will remove the limit. Use carefully because it may impact the service.

    Values for the property. Multiple values per property are interpreted as an OR operation.
    Optionally one of these operations `=,!,!=,>,>=,<,<=` can be included at the beginning of the value.
    By default the equality operation is used. 
    The values available for datetime fields (Ex: `created`, `startedAt`) are `hour`, `day`, `week`, `month` and `year`.
    Property `kind`, if included in the filter, will be matched using a case-insensitive comparison.
    For example, `kind:Pod` and `kind:pod` will bring up all pods. This is to maintain compatibility with Search V1.
